# FlixVision API URL Rewriting Configuration
# This file configures URL rewriting for the FlixVision module endpoints
# It maps client-facing JSON endpoints to their PHP handler script

# Enable the Apache rewrite engine
RewriteEngine On

# Configuration URL Mappings
# Map various JSON endpoint names to the config.php processor
# This allows clients to use different URL patterns while maintaining a single handler

# Map cg.json requests to the config.php handler
# This endpoint is used by legacy FlixVision clients
RewriteRule ^cg\.json$ config.php [L]

# Map conf.json requests to the config.php handler
# This endpoint is used by newer FlixVision clients
RewriteRule ^conf\.json$ config.php [L]

# Flag Explanations:
# L = Last rule, stop processing rules if this one matches
